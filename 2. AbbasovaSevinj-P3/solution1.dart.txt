Mixins are a way of defining code that can be reused in multiple class hierarchies. They are intended to provide member implementations en masse.

class Maestro extends Person with Musical, Aggressive, Demented {
  Maestro(String maestroName) {
    name = maestroName;
    canConduct = true;
  }
}

Mixins are a way to reuse code across multiple class
hierarchies without direct inheritance;
Unlike classes, mixins cannot be instantiated;
Declared using the mixin keyword in Dart;
Attached to class using with keyword;

mixin Swimmer {
void swim() {
print("Swimming...");
}
}
class Fish with Swimmer {}
class OlympicSwimmer with Swimmer {}
