Named Parameters
Named parameters are explicitly labeled when passed into a function. They are defined using curly braces `{}` in the function declaration.
Named parameters are great for improving code readability, as the names make the purpose of the argument clear.
Named parameters are typically optional, but you can make them mandatory using the `required` keyword.
  String greet(String name, String title) {
  return 'Hello $title $name!';
}

void main() {
  print(greet('Asiman', 'Student'));
}

Positional Parameters
Positional parameters are passed based on their position or order in the function call. They are defined without curly braces.
Positional parameters are concise and useful when the order of arguments is intuitive or when there are fewer parameters.
Positional parameters can be mandatory or optional. To make them optional, enclose them in square brackets `[]`.
  void greet(String name, [String? message]) {
    print('$name: $message');
  }
  greet('Asiman', 'how are you!');
  

When to Use Each?
Named Parameters-Use them for functions with many parameters, or when the arguments' meaning isn't immediately obvious, like in a complex configuration setup.
Positional Parameters- Use them for simpler functions with few arguments, especially when the argument order is straightforward and intuitive.
