A mixin in Dart is a way to reuse a class's code in multiple class hierarchies. It allows you to inject functionality into a class without using inheritance.
How to use mixins ? Let's create a mixin with the help of this code:

STEP 1: CREATE A MIXIN !

mixin MyMixin {
  void write(String message) {
    print('Write: $message');
  }
}

STEP 2: USE IT IN A CLASS !

class Dog with MyMixin {
  String name;

  Dog(this.name);

  void bark() {
    print('$name says Woof!');
  }
} 

STEP 3: LET'S USE IT IN MAIN !

void main() {
  var myDog = Dog('Poli');
  myDog.bark();
  myDog.log('HAV HAV HAV');
} 

We mostly use this at these time:
1) When multiple classes share common behaviours or functionalities.
2) When traditional inheritance doesn't fit well due to multiple inheritance limitations or complex relationships.
3) When organizing code for better maintainability and readability.
