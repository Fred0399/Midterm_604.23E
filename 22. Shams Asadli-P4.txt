    //Abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated;
//It's like incomplete blueprint.
//Used to define a base class that other classes can extend;
//Contains abstract methods (without implementation)
//Abstract classes are useful when many classes share the same structure but have different behaviors.
    // But Mixin is a way to reuse code in multiple classes without inheritance.
//It’s like giving a class extra abilities, like saying "now you can also swim!"
//You can’t create an object from a mixin.
//You define it using the mixin keyword and add it to a class with the with keyword.
    //A class is like a blueprint or template for creating things (called objects). 
//Use class for encapsulation, modularity and reusability.
// In Dart we use class keyword.
